# KMeansSuperTreeClustering
A new fast method for clustering phylogenetic trees using K-means and inferring multiple supertrees

# About
    => =============================================================================================================================
    => Program   : KMeansSuperTreeClustering - 2021
    => Authors   : Nadia Tahiri and Vladimir Makarenkov (Université du Québec à Montréal)
                   Bernard Fichet (Laboratoire d’Informatique Fondamentale de Marseille)
    => This program clusters phylogenetic trees using the k-means partitioning algorithm.
    => These trees may have the same or different, but mutually overlapping, sets of leaves (the multiple supertree problem).
    => Phylogenetic trees must be given in the Newick format (program input).
    => A partitioning of the input trees in K clusters of trees is returned as output. 
    => The optimal number of clusters can be determined either by the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) or by the Ball-Hall (BH) cluster 
    => validity index adapted for tree clustering.
    => A supertree can then be inferred for each cluster of trees.
    => The Robinson and Foulds topological distance is used in the objective function of K-means.
    => The list of the program parameters is specified below.

# Installation
    $ git clone https://github.com/iambenjaminalbertelli/TestPhylogenetic.git
    $ make
    or
    $ make install

    clean project
    $ make clean

# Help
    $ make help

# Examples
    Please execute the following command line:
    => For trees: ./KMPTC -tree input_file cluster_validity_index α Kmin Kmax

    => input_file: the input file for the program
    => cluster_validity_index: the cluster validity index used in K-means (1 for Calinski-Harabasz and 2 for Ball-Hall)
    => α: is the penalty parameter for species overlap in phylogenetic trees (must be between 0 and 1)
    => Kmin: is the minimum number of clusters in K-means. 
            - For CH, Kmin>=2,
            - For BH, Kmin>=1.
    => Kmax: the maximum number of clusters in K-means. 
            - Kmax must be less or equal to N-1 (where N is the number of input trees).

    Command line execution examples:
         1) input_file = data/Covid-19_trees.txt, cluster_validity_index = CH, α = 0.1, Kmin = 3, Kmax = 8):
        ./KMPTC -tree ../data/Covid-19_trees.txt 1 0.1 3 8
         2) input_file = data/all_trees_woese.txt, cluster_validity_index = CH, α = 1, Kmin = 2, Kmax = 10):
        ./KMPTC -tree ../data/all_trees_woese.txt 1 1 2 10

# Input
    => The input data sets are located in the folder "data"

# Output
    => See the folder "output"
    The output is in the following files:
    1) stat.csv - for the clustering statistics;
    2) output.txt - for the cluster content.
